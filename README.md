# ILPCW2
See [the coursework instructions](https://github.com/adamb56789/Drone-Control-CW/blob/main/coursework-document.pdf) for a description of the task, and the [final report](https://github.com/adamb56789/Drone-Control-CW/blob/main/Final%20Report.pdf) for information about the algorithms, design, and implementation.

Note: the final report may seem a bit odd or limited in some places, this is because there were specific instructions and limits we had to follow. I would have preferred to write more about some things and less about others - some of it is basically just a copy of parts of the JavaDoc.
